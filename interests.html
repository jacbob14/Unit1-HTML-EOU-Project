                When I was 8 years old, I started playing the piano. At first, I learned how to play <br>
                classical music first, and then learned how to play jazz and latin songs by <br>
                Latin American artists like Santana. Finally, for the last year, I have been <br>
                focosuing on improving my classical skills. Because of this, I landed a spot <br>
                at Carnegie hall this past April, 2025, for the first time. I plan to continue <br>
                playing piano for a while.

                For a few years, I have been playing chess. The reason I love to play this fun game <br>
                is because its challenging and requires the players to think hard about their moves. <br>
                In addition, many others play chess online and in championships, so I can always <br>
                have a fun and unique way to watch a chess master's games.

                I love to stay active by doing sporty activities. One of my favorites <br>
                is playing pickleball. When I was at sleepaway camp for seven weeks <br>
                this summer, I played pickleball for more than two hours a day! <br>
                Now, I am a part of the Bergen Tech Cross Country Team, and have <br>
             up to two meets a week. Every day, I have a practice at Bergen Tech.
