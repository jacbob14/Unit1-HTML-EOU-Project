        <h3>Why BT?</h3>
        <p>
            You may be wondering: why would I choose Computer Science over other fields to major in? The reason why is because unlike other careers, Comp Sci can be applied to many other fields such as medicine, or business and finance. AI robots in surgeries is a hot take in today's society and I can be the person who helps protrude this breakthrough. Specifically, I chose to study in Bergen Tech because the school has been an "Apple Destinguished School" for many years meaning it has been recognized by the largest tech companies for its pristine education. The school is also 9th place overall, for New Jersey public high schools.

        <h3>Career Goals</h3>
        <p>
            I don't have a refined image of what college I want to go to, or where I would like to work when I leave college. However, I know that I want to combine my programming and coding skills to other fields, especially the medical field, where Artificial Intelligence is starting to be integrated into curing diseases and assisting with live surgery. Before I leave Bergen Tech, I would like a solid understanding of what being a programmer means, and real career experience, for example, internships.
